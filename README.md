# Kotlin - MVVM - LiveData - Retrofit - CallBack 


An android mobile application that lists and updates playlists in the user's channel instantly via LiveData via Youtube Data V3 API.
- The MVVM architecture and the UI and business logic in the application are separated and a more legible code design is provided.
- Using LiveData; If there is a change in the list of MutableLiveData that holds playlists returned from the API in the ViewModel, the data is updated immediately in the UI.
- Response values from Retrofit and API were transferred to ViewModel via CallBack interface.
